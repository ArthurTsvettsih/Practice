## Graphs
- Similarly to trees, Graphs are a collection of nodes
- Trees are a specialised Graph
- Edge is a connection between 2 nodes
- There is no concept of root/head or children in Graphs
- Not all nodes need to be connected
- Graphs can contain cycles
- Graphs are used all over, e.g. Search engines use graphs to represent websites or maps can be represented as graphs, with cities being the nodes and the roads the egdes
- Edges have 2 types:
    - Directed or undirected (graphs)
    - Weighted or unweighted (graphs)
- The maximum amount of edges in a directed graph is _n * (n - 1)_, which is nearly _n^2_. Furthermore, in some cases a node can link back to itself, which would make the maximum number of nodes _n^2_
- Unidirected graph has a maximum of _(n * (n - 1)) / 2_ edges, which is nearly half as many edges as directed graphs
- If a graph has significantly less than _n^2_ edges, then it is called _Sparse_, e.g. a graph with n edges or even 2n edges
- A graph close to the maximum number of edges, is called _Dense_
- Graphs can be created by
    - Adjacency list, which is very similar to the base Node we created for trees, with an extra property for Weight. This method is space efficient, but not time efficient
    - Adjacency matrix, which is a 2D array. This method is time efficient but not space efficient
- Spannin Trees show the cheapest path to connect all nodes without a cycle
- Spanning Trees can be created by
    - Picking the cheapest edges as long as it does not create a cycle
    - Traverse the Graph using the cheapest edge out of all the edges that are currently connected
